# Effective-DynamicThreshold-Major
Dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation is considered an effective approach for improving power consumption and computing resource utilization in cloud-based data centers.
However, the ever-changing workload in a data center makes it difficult for VM consolidation to prevent service level agreement (SLA) violations and optimize power consumption.
Detection of overutilized and underutilized physical machines (PMs) plays a significant role in effective VM consolidation, immediately improving resource utilization, SLA violations, and power consumption.
